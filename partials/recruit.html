	<h1>Why go greek?</h1>
	<p>Membership in a Greek letter organization is a lifetime obligation. Choosing the Greek community means working with a group of men and women who can exchange and stand for common goals and ideas and being held to a higher standard than other college students. The Greek experience during the college years is a gateway to many rewards and connections later in life. Membership will be an unwritten bond of friendship no matter what course a young man's life takes.</p>
	<h1>Why Pi Kappa Phi?</h1>
	<p>Here at Pi Kappa Phi, we pride ourselves in being the Gentlemenâ€™s fraternity on campus. The men of Pi Kappa Phi are men of CLASS: Character, Leadership, Academics, Service, and Sportsmanship. These five attributes symbolize the values of our fraternity. Our members strive to attain a balance of character, effective leadership skills, academic distinction, volunteering experience, social excellence and athletic prominence, creating a balanced life unparalleled to that of any other chapter. We are consistently strong in grades and have a large diversity of majors amongst our members. Both the current ASUW student body president and the IFC president are members of Pi Kappa Phi and we also have one other member on the IFC executive board. It is the goal of Pi Kappa Phi to be the premier leadership fraternity here on campus, and for our brothers to leave after four years as greater men. We have been at the University of Washington since 1924, and continue to be one of the most active houses in the Greek community.</p>
